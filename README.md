Crystal Collector
a crystal collector game where a random number is generated and your goal is to click on the 'bit gems' to match the number but not go over!

this game uses html, css, and javascript, and initally created on 1/16/20 by Ben Mulholland

gem images and background were created by me in piskellapp

things yet to be added: sound effects for buttons clicked, background sound when overshooting the number, background sound when getting the correct number,
