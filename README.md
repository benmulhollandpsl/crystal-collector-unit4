Crystal Collector

A crystal collector game where a random number is generated and your goal is to click on the 'bit gems' to match the number but not go over!

this game uses html, css, and javascript, and initally created on 1/16/20 by Ben Mulholland as part of a homework assignment

gem images and background were created by me in piskelapp.com (my current favorite)

things yet to be added: displaying numbers when clicking on gems and alerts when losing or winning the game.  

suggestions are helpful and feedback is always a gift.  Please feel free to comment on areas of my code that aren't working or could be improved, but as this is homework, please refrain from giving me direct solutions.
